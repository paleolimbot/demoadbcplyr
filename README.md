# demoadbcplyr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of demoadbcplyr is to be a proof-of-concept for the hardest
possible use of dbplyr generating SQL to send to an ADBC driver. This
example uses the ADBC FlightSQL driver, which itself wraps a connection
to DuckDB. The proof-of-concept here uses dbplyr with a DBI connection
that is pretending to be Postgres for just long enough to generate
Postgres-flavoured SQL.

## Installation

You can install the development version of demoadbcplyr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("paleolimbot/demoadbcplyr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# Start the FlightSQL test server with `docker compose up`, requires ~1 GB download

library(demoadbcplyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

Sys.setenv(R_WRAPPER_FLIGHTSQL_TEST_URI = "grpc+tls://localhost:31337")
con <- wrapper_test_con()
tbl(con, "NATION") |> 
  arrange(n_nationkey)
#> # Source:     SQL [?? x 4]
#> # Database:   WrapperConnection
#> # Ordered by: n_nationkey
#>    n_nationkey n_name    n_regionkey n_comment
